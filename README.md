I created a responsive landing page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my internship at Prodigy Tech.
The project involved designing a user-friendly interface that adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes and includes interactive features like a sticky navigation bar and animated elements.
For the logos I used Remixicon.com
For the font I used fonts.google.com
